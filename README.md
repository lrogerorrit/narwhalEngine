# NarwhalEngine

Narwhal Engine is a custom vulkan engine im making for my final undergrad project. The objective with this engine is to manage to render black holes via ray casting (ray marching). Im currently working on it so dont expect it work yet.
It adapts this Unity black hole implementation into vulkan https://blog.seanholloway.com/2022/03/13/visualizing-black-holes-with-general-relativistic-ray-tracing/
